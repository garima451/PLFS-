This project presents a focused analysis of India's labour market using the Principal + Subsidiary Status (PS+SS) approach from official survey data.
The data used in this analysis is taken from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), conducted by the National Statistical Office (NSO) under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), Government of India.
PLFS is one of the most comprehensive and authoritative sources of labour market statistics in India, ensuring that this project is grounded in high-quality and reliable data.
The indicators studied include:
- Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR)
- Worker Population Ratio (WPR)
- Unemployment Rate (UR)

 Why Only PS+SS?
I chose to work exclusively with the PS+SS (Principal + Subsidiary Status) definition because it provides a long-term and stable view of an individual's employment status over the entire reference year. Unlike the Current Weekly Status (CWS), which reflects short-term or seasonal changes, PS+SS captures deeper structural trends in employment. This made it ideal for drawing more consistent and reliable insights, especially when analyzing long-term gender and regional disparities.

Key Insight
One of the most striking findings from the analysis was:
> Female workforce participation in urban areas is consistently lower than in rural areas, despite urban regions having better access to education and infrastructure.

This insight highlights potential socio-cultural and structural barriers that limit women's workforce engagement in urban settings—such as lack of flexible job opportunities, safety concerns, or social norms—despite the availability of resources.

By focusing on PS+SS data, I ensured that this observation is rooted in year-long activity pattern*, offering a more grounded understanding of gendered labour participation across India's rural-urban divide.
